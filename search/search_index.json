Course description Explore the principles and techniques of virtual and augmented reality. Learn the main properties of human sensory modalities and the principles of the sensory-motor loop involved when interacting with the physical and virtual worlds. Identify technological interfaces and displays used for human-machine interaction. Understand the models and algorithms used for the interactive and real-time multi-modal rendering of the virtual scene. 3 ECTS credits 18h lectures + 10h tutorials Learning outcome Basic knowledge on human spatial and multi-modal perception and cognition. Understanding of the main audio-visual rendering techniques. Learn to design and implement a simple VR application. Pre-requisites Basic knowledge on computer graphics, signal processing and programming.
